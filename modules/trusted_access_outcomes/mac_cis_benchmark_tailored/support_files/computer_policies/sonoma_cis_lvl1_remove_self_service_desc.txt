### About This Policy

This will remove CIS Level 1 enforcement from your computer. This policy is *not* a policy you would want to deploy in a production environment and is only made available for testing purposes and to remove the CIS benchmarks for the purposes of The Jamf Experience.

### Jamf Pro Policies

Policies allow you to remotely automate common management tasks on managed computers. Policies go beyond the MDM framework to allow for more advanced workflows and automation. Using a Policy, you can run scripts, manage accounts, complete maintenance tasks, and more. Leveraging Triggers, Smart Computer Groups, and Self Service within Jamf Pro you can ensure the right users or endpoints receive the correct policies at the right time whether automatically or made available in Self Service.
