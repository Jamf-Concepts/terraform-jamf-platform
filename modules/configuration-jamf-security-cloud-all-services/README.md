**This module requires both Jamf Pro and Jamf Security Cloud credentials.**

Running this will complete the following steps:

- Create an Activation Profile in Jamf Security Cloud with Network Security and Content Controls
- Collect the Activation Profile plist and create a new Configuration Profile in Jamf Pro
- Create a category named "Jamf Security Cloud - Activation Profiles" in Jamf Pro and assign the newly created Configuration Profile to that category
