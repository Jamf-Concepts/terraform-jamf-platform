### About This Policy

This will apply CIS Level 1 enforcement to your machine. CIS Benchmarks are a set of best practice security configuration guidelines developed to help organizations secure their IT systems and networks, mitigate vulnerabilities, and reduce risk of security breaches. These guidelines are created and maintained by the Center for Internet Security (CIS), covering various technologies including operating systems, middleware, software applications, and network devices. Jamf Compliance Editor is a tool that provides macOS, iOS/iPadOS system administrators with an easy way to establish and manage compliance baselines, like CIS, on their fleet of Apple devices. Jamf Compliance Editor allows an admin to choose a set of controls to be uploaded directly to their Jamf Pro server for deployment. Jamf Protect can then monitor these baselines when deployed and reports on them via the Compliance Baseline Summary **Please ensure you are using a test machine as some of the CIS controls can disrupt current workflows on a Production machine. **

### Jamf Pro Policies

Policies allow you to remotely automate common management tasks on managed computers. Policies go beyond the MDM framework to allow for more advanced workflows and automation. Using a Policy, you can run scripts, manage accounts, complete maintenance tasks, and more. Leveraging Triggers, Smart Computer Groups, and Self Service within Jamf Pro you can ensure the right users or endpoints receive the correct policies at the right time whether automatically or made available in Self Service.
