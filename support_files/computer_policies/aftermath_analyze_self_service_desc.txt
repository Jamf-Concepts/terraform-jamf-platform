### About Aftermath Incident Response Log Collection
In addition to the capabilities that are highlighted in **Malware Detection & Incident Response**, to detect and remediate security incidents, Jamf also has the ability to collect extensive system logs when a threat occurs that enables security admins, researchers, or consultants to forensically investigate security incidents.

### About Aftermath
Aftermath is an open source incident response framework built by Jamf. Paired with a [Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) playbook](https://github.com/jamf/jamfprotect/tree/main/soar_playbooks/aftermath_collection) these logs can be sent to a cloud storage service such as an AWS S3 bucket for analysis by internal or consulting security teams.
